## Business Logic Validation

### Notification Handling
1. When a new notification is created, it should:
   - Appear in the user's notification list
   - Show a red badge indicator if unread
   - Be dismissible by the user
   - Update read status when viewed

2. Admin notification sending should:
   - Allow selection of target audience
   - Support different priority levels
   - Include expiration dates
   - Track delivery statistics

### Contact Management
1. User inquiries should:
   - Be stored in the database with timestamp
   - Appear in admin panel with status
   - Support status updates by admin
   - Notify admin of new inquiries

2. Contact details should:
   - Be editable only by admins
   - Display correctly on contact page
   - Support all contact methods (email, phone, address)

### Revenue Tracking
1. Transaction data should:
   - Be aggregated for dashboard display
   - Show in detailed transaction list
   - Support filtering by date/status
   - Calculate totals accurately

2. Payment gateway configuration should:
   - Support multiple providers (Razorpay, Cashfree, Paytm, Stripe)
   - Allow enabling/disabling gateways
   - Store credentials securely
   - Validate configuration changes

### Favorites Management
1. User favorites should:
   - Persist across sessions
   - Sync in real-time across devices
   - Update UI immediately when toggled
   - Be manageable from user profile

### Translation System
1. Language switching should:
   - Update all UI text immediately
   - Remember user preference
   - Support all supported languages
   - Handle missing translations gracefully

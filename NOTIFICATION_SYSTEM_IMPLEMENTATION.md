## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `src/types/notifications.ts` - Comprehensive type definitions
- `src/services/notificationService.ts` - Core notification service
- `src/services/mobileVREnhancements.ts` - Mobile VR enhancement service
- `src/context/NotificationContext.tsx` - Global notification state management
- `firestore-notification-rules.rules` - Firestore security rules

### Enhanced Files
- `src/components/AdminPanel.tsx` - Added notification triggers and management
- `src/components/mobile/MobileVRExperience.tsx` - Enhanced with touch controls and VR settings
- `src/components/mobile/MobileNotifications.tsx` - Real-time Firebase integration
- `src/components/mobile/MobileNavigation.tsx` - Notification badges and animations
- `public/sw.js` - Enhanced push notification handling

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Firebase Configuration
Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY=your_vapid_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_FCM_SERVER_KEY=your_server_key_here
```

### 2. Firestore Security Rules
Deploy the security rules from `firestore-notification-rules.rules`:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 3. Firebase Cloud Functions (Optional)
For server-side push notifications, create Firebase Cloud Functions to send FCM messages when notifications are created.

### 4. Notification Permissions
Users will be prompted to allow notifications when they first interact with the notification system. This is handled automatically by the `NotificationContext`.

## üéØ Usage Guide

### For Admins
1. **Adding Destinations/VR Tours**: 
   - Navigate to Admin Panel ‚Üí Destinations/Videos
   - Add new content - notifications are sent automatically
   
2. **Custom Announcements**:
   - Admin Panel ‚Üí Notifications tab
   - Create custom announcements with targeting and priority options

### For Users
1. **Receiving Notifications**:
   - Real-time notifications appear in the mobile navigation bell icon
   - Push notifications are sent to devices (with permission)
   - Notification badge shows unread count

2. **Mobile VR Experience**:
   - Tap to toggle controls
   - Double-tap to play/pause
   - Swipe left/right to change videos
   - Swipe up for fullscreen
   - Settings icon for quality and device info

## üîç Testing the Implementation

### Manual Testing
1. **Admin Notification Flow**:
   - Login as admin
   - Add a new destination or VR tour
   - Check that notifications appear for users in real-time

2. **Mobile VR Experience**:
   - Open VR experience on mobile
   - Test touch gestures and controls
   - Verify haptic feedback (on supported devices)
   - Test fullscreen and orientation lock

3. **Push Notifications**:
   - Grant notification permission
   - Add content as admin
   - Verify push notifications are received (may take a few minutes)

### Browser Testing
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support for all features
- **Safari**: Limited push notification support
- **Firefox**: Good support for most features

### Mobile Testing
- **Android Chrome**: Full PWA and notification support
- **iOS Safari**: Limited push notification support
- **Samsung Internet**: Good support

## üìä Analytics & Monitoring

### VR Analytics Tracked
- Session duration
- Video completion rates
- Quality level usage
- Touch gesture interactions
- Device orientation patterns

### Notification Analytics
- Delivery rates
- Read rates
- Click-through rates
- Dismissal patterns

## üîß Customization Options

### Notification Types
- `destination` - New destination announcements
- `vr_tour` - New VR experience announcements  
- `announcement` - Custom admin announcements
- `system` - System maintenance/updates

### Priority Levels
- `urgent` - Requires user interaction
- `high` - Important notifications with sound

## üõü Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Notifications not appearing**:
   - Check browser notification permissions
   - Verify Firebase configuration
   - Check console for errors

2. **VR controls not working**:
   - Ensure touch events are enabled
   - Check if running on HTTPS (required for some features)
   - Verify device has touch capability

3. **Service Worker issues**:
   - Clear browser cache and reload
   - Check if service worker is registered properly
   - Verify HTTPS connection (required for service workers)

### Firebase Debugging
```javascript
// Enable Firestore debug logging
import { enableNetwork, disableNetwork } from 'firebase/firestore';

// Check Firestore connection
console.log('Firestore connected:', navigator.onLine);
```

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- **Lazy loading** of notification components
- **Debounced** real-time listeners
- **Cached** notification data in service worker
- **Optimized** VR video quality based on network speed
- **Battery-aware** VR performance scaling

### Recommended Monitoring
- Monitor Firestore read/write usage
- Track notification delivery success rates
- Monitor VR session performance metrics
- Watch for memory leaks in long VR sessions

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
